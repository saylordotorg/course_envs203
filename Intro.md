Course Syllabus for "ENVS203: Environmental Ethics, Justice, and World Views"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce the concept of environmental ethics, a
philosophy that extends the ethical concepts traditionally applied to
human behavior to address the entire natural world. The course will
outline the history of environmental ethics, discuss the idea of
environmental justice, and explore how our views about the natural world
have changed over time. Though environmental ethics is considered a
fairly new branch of scientific philosophy, it has actually been debated
avidly since the 19th century. From the frontier era of the developing
United States through to the modern-day environmental movement, you will
identify and analyze the key pioneers and events in the move to help
preserve our planet for future generations and species. You will also
explore the notion of environmental justice and how this impacts certain
social groups, particularly in poorer communities throughout the world.
Finally, you will familiarize yourself with the major environmental laws
and world views that support the environmental movement, and examine how
our ethics and morals help to shape our environmental regulations for
the better. This course is designed to align with a Thomas Edison State
College TECEP examination. Visit the [TECEP
