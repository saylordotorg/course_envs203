**Unit 5: Environmental Law** <span id="5"></span> 
*While moral codes and ethics are considered the foundations of our
attitudes towards our environment, these positions are often forgotten
when economics come into play. It is therefore important to establish
environmental laws for us to abide by. Since the 1960s, the
environmental movement has pushed for ever-increasing changes to our
laws, and has often secured great success. This unit will explore how
the introduction of laws to protect our environment has altered and
benefited the world in which we live. We will also consider major
environmental laws within both the United States and the European Union
(arguably the most advanced in environmental law application).*

     Instructions: This article introduces environmental history in the
    United States in the context of both federal and state laws. It also
    briefly discusses international treaties and conventions. Can you
    pick out one point in the history of environmental law that may have
    been the most influential?  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: The article begins by introducing the disciplines in
    which environmental history had its origins and the reasons it
    developed as a separate area of study. It goes on to define
    environmental history as the study of interactions of humans with
    the natural world, and explore how human ideas about the world, as
    well as human actions, have affected the environment. The article
    also discusses the recent environmental movement in Europe. As you
    finish the article, reflect on whether you believe that
    environmental law was borne out of a development in our ethical
    attitudes or a response to a rapid deterioration of our environment
    – or indeed both.

    exam **[here](http://www2.tesc.edu/tecep.php?CourseCode=ETH-210)**.

    that exam will earn students **3 hours** of college credit, which
    can be applied to a Thomas Edison State College degree program, or
    potentially transfered to another college.  
      
     *If you choose to take the TECEP exam, upon completion you will be
    prompted to take a short survey. We encourage that you take the time
    to fill this out, as it will allow you to tell Thomas Edison State
    College that you used Saylor materials to prepare for their exam.
    This information can be useful in encouraging the development of
    additional TECEP exams and credit opportunities aligned to Saylor
    courses.*
