**Unit 1: Ethics and the Environment** <span id="1"></span> 
*Our ethics and morals are the basis for how we respond to and act
towards the world around us. What we define as right and wrong is
influenced by many factors: our peers, our society, our religion, and
those who teach us. Historically, we have typically applied the concept
of ethical behavior to our interactions with fellow human beings. In
recent years, however, we have begun to apply this sense of ethical
conduct to the environment and to the idea of sustaining the world in
which we live. We have become aware, in recent decades, of a long
history of environmental mismanagement, and a growing environmental
movement seeks to change attitudes and prevent further degradation. This
unit will explore how we define ethical behavior, take a detailed look
at the major branches of ethics, and explore its application to our
environment.*

    change propaganda?  
        
     As you watch the video, also question your understanding of how
    actions in one part of the world can affect other parts of the
    world. The basis of this argument begins to form the idea of

    decisions about environmental issues made during recent world
    summits, which greatly determine the future for ethical approaches
    to our climate, and how these goals may be met while still
    maintaining global development. As you listen, attempt to make a
    stance on what you believe is the right thing to do in balancing the
    future of our climate with economic growth.
