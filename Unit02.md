**Unit 2: Environmental Ethics Approaches and World Views** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit will discuss the major approaches to environmental ethics and
how they seek a balance between human prosperity and environmental
sustainability. The unit will explore the spectrum of views from
utilitarian conservation (looking at the value of our natural resources
for human consumption) through biocentric preservation (the protection
of nature because all life deserves respect). The unit will also explore
the Gaia hypothesis, and study how perceived self-regulation of the
Earth’s climate may impact the world around us. We will also take a look
at religious views towards our environment and how these have developed
throughout history.*

     Instructions: Watch this video lecture. It is the first of four
    videos that will introduce the four key environmental ethical
    beliefs: Anthropocentrism, Biocentrism, Ecocentrism, and Deep
    Ecology. Take notes and compare this viewpoint with those discussed
    in the other videos in Subunits 2.1.2.2, 2.1.3.2, and 2.1.4.4.  
        
     After you have watched all four lectures, attempt to identify which
    of these views is closest to your own beliefs. This can often be
    hard to do, and while we may think that our ethics regarding the
    environment rest in one place, they can often be very different when
    we truly analyze our behavior.

    that you may choose to agree or disagree with.
